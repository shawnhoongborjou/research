## Lockheed-Martin "Intrusion Kill Chain" framework 2011
1. Reconnaissance       - Intruder selects target, researches it and attemptes to identify vulnerabilities in the target network.
2. Weaponization        - Intruder creates remote access malware weapon (e.g., virus, worm) tailored to one or more vulnerabilities
3. Delivery             - Intruder transmits weapon to target (e.g., via e-mail attachments, webistes, USB drives)
4. Exploitation         - Malware weapon's program code triggers, which takes action on target network to exploit vulnerability
5. Installation         - Malware weapon installs access point (e.g., "backdoor") usable by intruder
6. Command and Control  - Malware enables intruder to have "hands on the keyboard", persistent access to target network
7. Actions on Objective - Intrduder takes action to achieve their goals (e.g., data exfiltration, data destruction, encryption for ransom)

1 |.com extension |Some computer virus writers have hoped to take advantage of modern computer users' likely lack of knowledge of the .com file extension and associated binary format, along with their more likely familiarity with the .com Internet domain name. E-mails have been sent with attachment names similar to "www.example.com". Unwary Microsoft Windows users clicking on such an attachment would expect to begin browsing a site named http://www.example.com/, but instead would run the attached binary command file named www.example, giving it full permission to do to their machine whatever its author had in mind. |
