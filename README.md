## Lockheed-Martin "Intrusion Kill Chain" framework 2011
1. Reconnaissance       - Intruder selects target, researches it and attemptes to identify vulnerabilities in the target network.
2. Weaponization        - Intruder creates remote access malware weapon (e.g., virus, worm) tailored to one or more vulnerabilities
3. Delivery             - Intruder transmits weapon to target (e.g., via e-mail attachments, webistes, USB drives)
4. Exploitation         - Malware weapon's program code triggers, which takes action on target network to exploit vulnerability
5. Installation         - Malware weapon installs access point (e.g., "backdoor") usable by intruder
6. Command and Control  - Malware enables intruder to have "hands on the keyboard", persistent access to target network
7. Actions on Objective - Intrduder takes action to achieve their goals (e.g., data exfiltration, data destruction, encryption for ransom)
